Earlier we laid out the basics for an app that tracks student progression. Teachers had the authority to confer qualifications upon a student after completing a course (or at checkpoints along the way). Somthing like a qualification certificate is a perfect use case for a non-fungible token. Most paper documents of this sort contain some basic info: title, name, date, authority, potential expiry, logo or signature, etcetera. Lets say you wanted to present your diploma to an institution to prove that you had already completed some Foundation Programming classes, it is likely the diploma would not be enough. The registrar at the potential school would contact the student's previous school to validate the claim. If only there was a trustless decentralised system that allowed for easy verification? Hmm....
